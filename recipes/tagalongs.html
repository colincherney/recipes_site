    <p>
      If you didn't get enough Tagalongs at the last Girls Scout cookie sale, no
      need to fret: you can make the classic cookies at home with this copycat
      recipe.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 cups flour</li>
      <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>8 ounces milk chocolate, chopped</li>
      <li>8 ounces chocolate-flavor candy coating, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium speed for
        30 seconds. Add sugar and salt and beat until well combined. Beat in egg
        yolks and vanilla. Mix in flour until dough forms. Chill, covered, until
        dough is easy to handle, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut
        dough with a 2-inch cookie cutter, rerolling scraps if needed. Arrange
        cutouts 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer
        to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, stir together powdered sugar, peanut butter, and cream.
        Spread 2 teaspoons . onto each cookie, leaving centers slightly mounded.
        Arrange on wax paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, arrange a wire rack over wax paper. Heat milk chocolate and
        candy coating in a small saucepan over low heat until melted. Spoon over
        cookies to cover, allowing excess to drip off. Let stand on prepared
        rack until set.
      </li>
    </ol>
