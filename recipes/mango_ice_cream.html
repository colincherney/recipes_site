    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 cups mango puree</li>
      <li>0.5 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Peel and dice mangoes. Place in a blender and blend until pureed;
        measure out 1 1/2 cups puree; set aside. Refrigerate remaining puree for
        another use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whip heavy cream and sugar with an electric mixer on high speed until
        soft peaks form. Reduce the mixer speed to low and mix in mango puree.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour into Ninja® CREAMi™ containers or into a freezer-safe bowl. Freeze
        for 24 hours if using Ninja® CREAMi™ or for 8 hours to overnight if
        freezing in a container.
      </li>
      <li>
        Following manufacturers instructions, insert the pint container into the
        outer bowl of Ninja® CREAMi™. Push “Ice Cream” button. If freezing in a
        container, remove from the freezer and let sit for 8 to 10 minutes or
        until soft enough to scoop.
      </li>
    </ol>
